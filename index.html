<a id="rules" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code of Conduct</h2>
Nigma and WWC are 2 organisations that encourages upcoming talent and promotes diversity within the industry. Code for DC is committed to providing a safe and welcoming space, without regard to age, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, mental or physical disability, physical appearance, religion, level of knowledge, level of experience, parental status, marital status, socioeconomic status or background, political affiliation, or any other attribute. Tha #HackTheHub team share the responsibility of enforcing these policies as necessary to maintain an open and welcoming environment.
<br>
<p>As the organizers of #HackTheHub, we believe that the below principles are essential to maintaining this environment. In addition, we believe that they are good principles for life in general. </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Keep Your Team Open </strong> - Except for instances where it would significantly impede productivity, there should always be room on a project for one more person. Unless doing so would be counter-productive to the goals of the project. </li><br>
<li> <strong> Do Not Harass </strong> - Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes offensive verbal comments, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. This will not be tolerated. </li> <br>
<li> <strong> Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others </strong> #HackTheHub is designed as a place for people of all different skill levels. As a result, we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However, we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.

Additionally, we expect that members will educate others respectfully. To this end, do not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.</li> <br>
</ul>

<h2>  <a id="rules" class="anchor" href="#aspirations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aspirations</h2>
While this document exists primarily to prevent certain bad behavior, we also believe that our community members should work towards a higher standard. To that end, we strongly encourage the following conduct, though they are considered aspirational rather than necessary.

<h3> Build With, Not For </h3>
Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in all stages of development. Seek out those who are under-represented, and remove barriers to access. Listen as much—or more—than you speak, and give full consideration to all ideas, even if they seem improbable at first.

<h3> Empower, Experiment, and Find a Way for Everybody to Contribute </h3>
When more people share their knowledge and skills, they give a project a greater chance to succeed. When somebody shows up with an unusual skill, look for ways to fit them into the team rather than reasons why it wouldn’t work. Experiment with new approaches, and don’t be afraid to try something that might not work.
